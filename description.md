# Technical Interview Process Description

The technical interview is broken down into 3 sections. These sections are the project submission, edges, and time for you to  ask any questions you'd like. Each of these sections are explained below in what they will entail. Before you go any further, write down some things about yourself that you want us to cover. If you think you shine or at something we want to know so that we can highlight those. The interview process is made around making sure that each candidate shines as much as they can. Everyone has gaps, but we want to know where you're at your best.

# Project Submission

The interviewing team and yourself will go over your  submission and talk about the solution. They may ask what you'd do next  for certain additions, but you will not have to do any live coding during this. We're looking for your ability to communicate decisions and talk things through. We may change some of the API scenarios to figure out what system changes we'd want to make as well.

# Edges

We'll walk through a list of topics from databases, languages, architecture patterns, and everything in between to see what  you're familiar with. This is meant to find "the edges" of your knowledge and make sure that we have a good understanding of your  breadth of knowledge as well. If you don't know much about a topic,  that's okay. We'll just move onto the next one. We understand that not everyone has experience with everything.  We'll usually start from your resume and go from there.

# Open for Questions

We like to give you time at the end to ask any questions  you have of us.  Any questions are fine.  This is to make sure you get  to interview us.

# Project Submission - Weather Service Assignment	

Write an HTTP server that serves the forecasted weather.  Your server should expose an endpoint that:

1. Accepts latitude and longitude coordinates
2. Returns the short forecast for that area for Today ("Partly Cloudy" etc)
3. Returns a characterization of whether the temperature is "hot",  "cold", or "moderate" (use your discretion on mapping temperatures to each type)
4. Use the [National Weather Service API Web Service](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api) as a data source.

The purpose of this exercise is to provide a sample of your work that we can discuss together in the Technical Interview.

- We respect your time.  Spend as long as you need, but we intend it to take around an hour.
- We do not expect a production-ready service, but you might want to comment on your shortcuts.
- The submitted project should build and have brief instructions so we can verify that it works.
- You may write in whatever language or stack you're most comfortable with, but the technical interviewers are most familiar with Typelevel Scala.
